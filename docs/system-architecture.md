# Identity Service Architecture

## Overview
The Identity Service is a core microservice responsible for managing authentication, authorization, and multi-tenant user management across the system. It serves as the central authority for user identity and access control.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Authentication Management
- Handles user authentication flows and session management
- Supports OAuth-based authentication with multiple providers
- Manages JWT token generation, validation, and rotation
- Provides secure session handling and management
- Implements rate limiting and security measures for failed login attempts

### 2. Multi-tenant System Management
- Supports multiple tenant types (Personal, Team, Enterprise)
- Manages tenant creation, configuration, and lifecycle
- Handles tenant switching and access control
- Enforces tenant-specific permissions and limitations
- Manages tenant templates and configurations

### 3. Authorization & Access Control
- Implements role-based access control (RBAC)
- Manages user permissions within tenants
- Handles IP whitelisting and security policies
- Enforces tenant-specific feature access
- Manages API key authentication for service-to-service communication

### 4. User Management
- Handles user registration and profile management
- Manages user-tenant relationships and memberships
- Supports user invitation and onboarding workflows
- Tracks user sessions and activity
- Manages user subscription and usage limits

### 5. Security Features
- Implements JWT-based secure token management
- Provides public key infrastructure for service-to-service authentication
- Manages secure password policies and validation
- Implements rate limiting and brute force protection
- Handles session invalidation and token revocation

## System Interactions

### Incoming Requests
- Authentication requests from client applications
- Token validation requests from other services
- User management operations
- Tenant management operations
- Session management requests

### Outgoing Interactions
- OAuth provider communications
- Event notifications for user/tenant changes
- Usage tracking and metrics
- Subscription service validations

## Technical Components

### Core Services
- Authentication Service: Handles authentication flows and token management
- Tenant Service: Manages tenant operations and configurations
- User Service: Handles user management and profiles
- Subscription Service: Manages tenant subscriptions and limits
- Usage Service: Tracks and enforces usage limits

### Middleware
- Authentication Middleware: Validates tokens and permissions
- Rate Limiting: Prevents abuse and enforces limits
- Tenant Context: Manages tenant-specific request context
- Error Handling: Standardizes error responses

### Data Storage
- User data
- Tenant configurations
- Session information
- Authentication records
- Security audit logs

## Security Considerations
- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- Tokens are regularly rotated
- Failed login attempts are tracked and limited
- IP whitelisting available for enterprise tenants
- Regular security audits and logging
